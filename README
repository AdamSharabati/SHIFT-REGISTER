Overview
This VHDL code implements an 8-bit shift register with three main operations: load, 
shift right, and shift left. A shift register is a digital memory circuit found in many applications, 
including data storage, data transfer, and digital signal processing.

The shift register has the following features:

8-bit input data (Din)
Clock and Reset inputs (clk, rst)
2-bit operation selection (OP)
8-bit output data (Qout)
Entity Description
Ports:
clk (in std_logic): Clock input. Operations are triggered on the rising edge of this clock.
rst (in std_logic): Asynchronous reset input. When rst = '0', the register is reset, and all output bits are set to '0'.
Din (in std_logic_vector(7 downto 0)): 8-bit input data to be loaded into the register when loading is selected.
OP (in std_logic_vector(1 downto 0)): Operation code to select the operation mode:
"01": Load the register with the input value (Din).
"10": Shift the register right by one bit (with 0 shifted into the most significant bit).
"11": Shift the register left by one bit (with 0 shifted into the least significant bit).
Qout (out std_logic_vector(7 downto 0)): 8-bit output data representing the current state of the register.
Architecture Description
Reset Condition: If the rst signal is low ('0'), the register is reset to all zeros (Qv := "00000000").

Clock Edge Detection: On each rising edge of the clk signal, the following operations can take place based on the value of OP:

Load (OP = "01"): Load the input data (Din) into the register.
Shift Right (OP = "10"): Shift the register one bit to the right. A zero is inserted into the most significant bit (MSB).
Shift Left (OP = "11"): Shift the register one bit to the left. A zero is inserted into the least significant bit (LSB).
Output Assignment: After each clock cycle, the register's value is assigned to the output Qout.

Usage Instructions
Inputs:
clk: This is the clock input. Connect it to a clock signal in your design. The operations occur on the rising edge of the clock.
rst: This is the asynchronous reset signal. To reset the shift register, set rst = '0'. This will reset all the bits in the register to '0'.
Din: This is the 8-bit data input. When the load operation (OP = "01") is selected, the value of Din will be loaded into the shift register.
OP: This is a 2-bit operation selector. Based on its value, different operations will be performed:
"01": Load the register with the value from Din.
"10": Shift the register right by one bit.
"11": Shift the register left by one bit.
Outputs:
Qout: This is the 8-bit output that represents the current state of the shift register after each operation.
